					  Georgia McKeown has thirty-five years of experience in public service, marketing, public
relations, and politics at both the state and national level. Her diversified experience offers a
broad network of personal, corporate, and government contacts throughout the state of Florida.
Georgia’s background in the private sector includes marketing for one of the top rated
engineering firms in the country during the 1960’s and 1970’s. She worked with local
municipalities to coordinate the firm’s environmental, civil, and construction management
engineering projects. She also assisted with the company’s expansion into the international
market.
<br /><br />
Georgia started her career in politics when she worked as the District Director for
Congressman Bill Chappell who served in Congress for twenty-two years and became the
Chairman of the powerful Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. She was responsible for all of
the district office operations and interactions with the Congressman’s constituency in the five
county District, as well as created a valuable network of resources at the federal level during her
tenure.
<br /><br />
After Georgia worked for Congressman Chappell, she went on to be the District Office
Manager for Congressman Craig James where she was responsible for the operation of the
Congressman’s three district offices including the management of all staff and constituent
services. Georgia acted as the Congressman’s liaison for local, state, non-profit and community-
based organizations. She later went on to serve as the District Representative for the late U.S.
Representative Tillie Fowler who as the Vice Chairman of the Republican Conference, was the
highest-ranking woman in the U.S. Congress when she retired. In this role, Georgia managed all
facets of the district operation for a tri-county area.
<br /><br />
In the Florida Legislature, Georgia served as a Jacksonville Senator’s Chief of Staff for
seven years. During his term of office, Georgia became the Jacksonville Senator’s “go to
person” for education policy issues and appropriation issues. Consequently, he was appointed
Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and Georgia played a key role in assisting him with
the preparation of Florida’s budget. In her capacity as Chief of Staff, Georgia was responsible
for collaborating with state agencies, consultants, and members of the Legislature. She directed
all media relations and communication efforts, managed the Senator’s legislative agenda as
well as oversaw the operations of both his Tallahassee and District offices.
<br /><br />
Prior to the former Jacksonville Senator’s successful election, Georgia served as his
Campaign Manager and Finance Director and crafted strategies that unseated a favored
incumbent. She also served as Campaign Manager for former Senator Bill Posey, now a U.S.
Congressman, as well as the former Senator and Commissioner of Agriculture, Charles
Bronson. Additionally, she managed the million dollar Senate campaign for the late Jim King,
who became President of the Florida Senate for the 2002-04 term. In her capacity as Campaign
Manager, Georgia functioned as Finance Director for all the campaigns, developing a broad
network of business contacts throughout Florida as well as pertinent experience.
<br /><br />
Georgia also played an integral role in establishing Florida’s new K-20 education
system. As Chief of Staff to the Commissioner of Education, she oversaw the operations for the
transition from Florida’s segmented educational system to a seamless system that incorporated
public schools, community colleges, and the state’s universities. Subsequently, Georgia was
appointed Deputy Commissioner for External Affairs and Government Relations. As Deputy
Commissioner, she directed all communications, media relations, community outreach, plus
legislative and federal affairs for one of the largest state agencies while interfacing with Florida’s
67 school districts. She also assisted in establishing the “Just Read,” Florida office within the
Department of Education which represented the backbone of Governor Jeb Bush’s education
policy goals.
<br /><br />
Georgia joined the private sector as an independent government consultant in 2003 after
twenty-three years of public service. She worked with a Tallahassee based firm who later
merged with an international, federal, state, and local consulting firm. She was named Vice
President and managed clients in a wide array of practice areas including agriculture,
transportation, energy, business development, education, health care, local government, and
human services.
<br /><br />
Most recently, in 2013, Georgia started her own firm, GA McKeown &amp; Associates, which
was a full-service lobbying, governmental consulting, and business development firm with
existing offices in Tallahassee and Daytona Beach, Florida. Georgia brings a fresh, extensive
and diversified background in both the public and private sectors to our firm and everyone on
Team JB.
