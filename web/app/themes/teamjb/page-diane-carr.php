						Diane began her career at the intersection of law, policy, and politics as a legislative intern for the Florida House of Representatives while she was still in law school at Florida State University.  On graduating from F.S.U.'s College of Law she returned to the Florida House as Counsel to the Commerce Committee where she learned to navigate the legislative process from the inside.  Over the past 25 years her career has evolved to encompass association management, lobbying, private law practice, and public administration.
						<br /><br />
						She has been recruited by the Governor and Cabinet for multiple regulatory and administrative positions, including appointment to the Board of the Florida Workers' Compensation Guaranty Association, and appointment to the Board of the Florida Workers' Compensation Joint Underwriting Association, which she was then elevated to Chair.
						<br /><br />
						Governor Jeb Bush subsequently appointed Diane as Secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation where she completed a stalled reengineering project of 30 plus business processes, implemented a constitutional ban on smoking in restaurants, and oversaw the reconstruction and re-roofing of the state in the wake of 7 hurricanes that ravaged the peninsula during the hurricane seasons of 2004-05.
						<br /><br />
						Currently, Diane relies on her public- and private-sector backgrounds to develop and advance legislative, regulatory, and political strategies as a registered lobbyist for clients from diverse segments of commerce and industry ranging from Fortune 500 companies to trade associations comprised of highly regulated businesses and professionals.  Additionally, Diane serves as the firm's General Counsel, advising the principals on administrative, operational, and transactional matters.
						<br /><br />
						Long devoted to promoting professionalism among lawyers who lobby, Diane is a member of the Florida Association of Professional Lobbyists, the Florida Bar's Governmental and Pubic Policy Advocacy Committee, and is a graduate of Leadership Florida.  Prior to joining the team at Johnson &amp; Blanton, Diane was in private law practice where she was continuously selected by her peers as one of the Best Lawyers in America for Government Relations Practice (2008-2016) and for Administrative/Regulatory Law (2010-2016).

									  <p>I went to law school thinking I wanted to be a litigator.  Then I had a year-long internship with the Florida House during my second year.  That changed everything.  I was intrigued by the lawmaking process and the legislators and staff who excel at it.  I decided to learn all that I could as a legislative intern, then as a staff attorney for the House Commerce Committee.  That was a plum assignment, working for a committee with huge jurisdiction over all of Florida's commercial, industrial, and financial enterprises.  It was then that I knew I wanted to be an advocate for business and professional interests before the Legislature and executive branch agencies.  And I've been very fortunate to have one opportunity after another to do just that.</p>
