						Dale Patchett was born and raised in Illinois where he attended Southern Illinois University. Following graduation, he began working for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Forestry in Vero Beach, Florida. Dale was elected to the Florida 
						House of Representatives in 1976 where he served seven consecutive terms, the last six years as the Republican Leader.
